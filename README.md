    Husky is a productivity extension
</p>

## Feature

- Quick glance at Github PRs and Issues
- Omnibox shortcuts (e.g. `hs <your keyword>` takes you to whatever address you have configured)
- ... More to come

_**Husky respects your privacy and does not collect any data.**_

It needs two permissions:

- Storage
  - Store settings locally
    - Github token
    - Configured shortcuts
- History
  - Show you suggestions from links you have visited
    - this will be made optional due make the extension more privacy friendly

## Install (With an option to build)

You can either download a prebuilt release from the right side or can build it yourself with:

```
git clone git@github.com:kamyar/husky.git
cd husky
yarn install
yarn build
```

And then inside Chrome go to extensions page and click "Load Unpacked" and select `build/chrome-mv3-prod`.

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
pnpm dev
# or
npm run dev
```

## Making production build

Run the following:

```bash
pnpm build
# or
npm run build
```

## Submit to the webstores

The easiest way to deploy your Plasmo extension is to use the built-in [bpp](https://bpp.browser.market) GitHub action. Prior to using this action however, make sure to build your extension and upload the first version to the store to establish the basic credentials. Then, simply follow [this setup instruction](https://docs.plasmo.com/framework/workflows/submit) and you should be on your way for automated submission!
